TASK
 How attackers enumerate Linux systems (3,5,6,8,11,12)
 	Network reachability and services ::::____::::

	Files and permissions they can abuse  ::::____::::

	Users with odd privileges   ::::____::::

	Processes with exploitable behavior ::::____::::

	Logs that show interesting activity ::::____::::
	
	
IN SHORT

	enumerates risk
	
	labels why it’s risky

	documents how to fix it

	optionally hardens the system


 How defenders identify and Reduce Risk
 	Identify Risk
 	Reduce Risk
 
 
 BUILDING
 		A tool that 
 			enumereates insecure Linux configurations  ( BASH)
		 	Flags common attack Vectors
DOCUMENTATION 
		Human Readable Security report
		
ADDITIONAL WORK
		Apply safe hardening actions with user confirmation
		
		
		
CHCECKING 
		 Attackers Abuse for privilege Escalation
		 	World Writable files ( group user and others)
		 	use SUID and GUID
				Identify risky User and wrong privileges 
					CHECK users with UID 0
					Users with sehll acc
					
Listening to ports for openeings and Unnecessary backgrounds 

Login attempts
	check failed for brute force 
	Check log of file permissions
	
	
	
	DOCUMENTATION (each process)
Title
Timestamp
Risk Category
Explanation of Findings 
Suggested mittigation and easy run up code (bash)


ADDITIONALLY 
	confirmation by user just to show trust, control and consent
	
	
DOCUMENTATION (Report)

	Overview
	Manual
	previous output with Images
	
	Threat model ( Attacker and Defender perspective)
	Checkings Explanation ( why each step was taken )
	Secure principles with the bash and how to modify
	
	
	
THINKING 

whoami, this will help know who has access
id, where they belong
groups what group they belong to, if any

what type of system is this:
	Distro
	Kernel
	Version
	
	Only important things to be displayed
	
other user, groups available remotely or locally. 

Background running , the services, necessary and unnecessary
open ports
what run as root

Touchable, 

world writable files 
SUID binaries 

::: Sensitive configurations


First of all :::: Gather information on who you are on the system and what previlege you have at the moment.


UID ran
:::::: important note, UID,GID,SUDO,ADM (access logs),WIRESHARK
